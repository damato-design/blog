Naming is [clearly something I think a lot about](/posts/truly-semantic). So when I saw [this tweet from Nathan Curtis](https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/1724500748388450587) about the way [Shaun Bent](https://twitter.com/shaunbent) and [his team at Spotify](https://spotify.design/) handle component composition has named slots, _I was triggered_. Hot takes activate, here's the image from the tweet:

## Pretweet

There's several words in here that are suggesting position. For this exploration I'll focus on the title area, specifically the areas above and below the title slot. The team has chosen the words pretitle and subtitle for these areas, respectively. Seeing this, I went through the following stream of thought:

Initially, I'd expect that the concepts should match. In other words, to choose either pre/post or super/sub. There's awkwardness in both choices. Choosing the former pair will result in a double-t (posttitle) while the latter pair will result in a suggested size of the title from the name (supertitle).

I've recently adopted the concept of "overline" from [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#applying-the-type-scale) for the area above headlines. While it might work using the word title (eg., "overtitle", "undertitle") it wouldn't for other typographic terms as we may end up with a very confusing "underline".

Which is where I decided I couldn't just reply to the tweet. I'm now conflicted about what I would name these areas so that they are clear to their purpose and relate to the title component appropriately. We need to go deeper.
