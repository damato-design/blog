This post is going to be a little different than others, as I expect to update it over time with resources I find about design engineering.

## [designengineer.xyz](https://designengineer.xyz)

This is one of the first websites I found dedicated to the recent hype. Launched by [Karl Koch](https://twitter.com/_kejk), it also seems to be one of the most fully covered with design engineering materials and resources such as related posts and jobs. There's also a related slack community.

## [designengineer.ing](https://designengineer.ing)

Launched by [Dr. Mehmet Aydın Baytaş](https://twitter.com/doctorbaytas). At the time of this writing this only shows an email waitlist. His feed suggests merch will be coming as well.

## [designerscancode.com](https://designerscancode.com)

Launched by [Lee Nelson](https://twitter.com/leemnelson_). This also includes a waitlist but seems to have a bit more polish and content than the other waitlist. It also discloses a few more features expected to launch, such as news and learning materials.

## [designengineer.io](https://designengineer.io)

Launched today by [Moe Amaya](https://twitter.com/moeamaya). This seems to be specifically a job board and it has a sleek design with many visual doodads. It's interesting that the bottom of the page says "Job board for design engineers...cause there isn't one" when there's one right at the top of this list!

## [ux.engineering](https://ux.engineering)

There's nothing at this domain, but I'll call it out because I own it! Is the space saturated? Is there something that these sites miss? Do I need another project to potentially maintain. All very good questions.
