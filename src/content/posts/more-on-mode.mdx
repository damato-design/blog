Since releasing [Mise en Mode](https://mode.place), I've seen a lot of interest in the approach but one question keeps appearing; _how would you do it?_ The article and presentation don't suggest how it's done because I believe the concept is more important to understand than getting lost in implementation. Further, tools aren't yet able to fully embrace this way of thinking, so I wouldn't want people to discount the approach just because their environment doesn't support it.

All that said, I'm going to describe how the approach could be executed and explain some additional points yet to be fully realized.

## Scoping values

The whole approach requires the ability to change what a design token's value is based on that token's appearance in a composition. We can set this up very easily in CSS, as it is one of the qualities of [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

```css
:root {
    --surface-bg: white;
}

[data-mode="dark"] {
    --surface-bg: black;
}
```

Now, in the composition, a person can choose where `data-mode="dark"` should be applied within the page at-large. This could be against the entire page by placing it on the `<body/>` or in the case described by Mise en Mode, a part of the page like `<footer/>`. Importantly, tokens that are defined in the default **must also be defined in subsequent modes**. This ensures that whatever elements appear within this newly defined context will have associated values for them; all the tokens must work together consistently for the presentation to be cohesive.

What Mise en Mode continues to suggest is that this isn't just meant for the concept of inverted but can be used to describe any area of the page that is meant to be expressively enhanced. This means that the weirdly colored card on the product marketing page _could_ be described as a separate mode; expressively enhancing the content within.

## Managing values

How to assign values to any particular mode should be trivial in our current state of tooling, and any tooling that allows you to curate a token structure and output that structure to a custom selector will do the job. Here's a very small example using the [DTCG format](https://tr.designtokens.org/).

```json5
// light-mode.json
{
    "surface-bg": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": "white"
    }
}

// dark-mode.json
{
    "surface-bg": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": "dark"
    }
}
```

You might be wondering why these are described as different files. My opinion is that the `.json` file structure should define the mode and only the mode within the context that it is meant to express. In other words, when I'm curating the values for what "dark mode" _means_, I do not care what that value is for light mode or any other modes. The values for light mode and dark mode should never coexist together through tokens; all values exist together within the boundary of a single mode. This is also why I feel some of the nested object structures in example token files are more noisy than helpful. Having values that represent `light` in the same file as `dark` is overwhelming and hinders focus in the value curation process.

So when an HTTP request for several modes comes into a server, your token processing toolchain should assign each of these collections under a different scope (eg., selector). That request could be "get me all modes" because there are no optimizations to determine what modes a page uses. The response would be CSS like this:

```css
/* styles.css */
[data-mode="light"] {
    --surface-bg: white;
}

[data-mode="dark"] {
    --surface-bg: black;
}
```

<Aside>
    I have thought about optimizations in this area and how we might determine what modes are assigned on a page. The trouble will be that it's possible modes are assigned dynamically through JavaScript so we'd effectively need some sort of listener that triggers a new request for additional values. I'm not sure that sort of optimization for network requests is warranted. I'm more confident that you should request all modes by default and allow an app to potentially curate the modes requested if they want to filter the response.
</Aside>

## Curating mode placement

From here, it is a matter of what you want to express and when. This means that a designer would curate what places the mode should be assigned. Again, here's a minimal example:

```html
<body data-mode="light">
    <footer data-mode="dark"></footer>
</body>
```

So here's the important new role for a designer in this world. Instead of going through an exercise in token naming, the exercise is now curating where this treatment is to be used in experiences. So a designer would identify areas of the experience and mark them to be expressively enhanced; meaning new values for existing semantic tokens. The new expressive mode may be used only once, which then may suppose the question if the expression is needed at all but does not constitute avoiding the expression completely. It also may be used multiple times if it is a common expression found across the experience.

What those new values are _may not_ be up to the same designer curating the placement of the modes. This is a difference between UX and UI. In the UX mindset, we want to convey information to the user and make a UX decision by identifying an area where we want to strengthen the message. The values that are needed to convey that expression are UI decisions; color, typography, etc.. For larger organizations, often those who need to support lots of expressions, these are typically different roles and responsibilities.

Importantly, each mode introduces a need to assign new values to all tokens within the mode. This is why it is critical to keep the number of tokens that need values as low as possible. This is done with a [semantic naming convention](/posts/truly-semantic). With each new mode, an entirely new set of values is required.

## How deep is your mode

A core tenet of Mise en Mode is the ability to nest modes to support scoped expressions. The big question here is, **how deep should the nesting go?** The reason this is important is because higher-level nesting will potentially influence lower levels. Certainly the less nesting, the less influence and therefore less complexity in choosing values.

To put this another way, consider these nested regions to work like blend modes. The application of a blend mode will affect the place it was added and any modes layered below it. The final result is a combination of the changes influenced by each mode through the layers.

</iframe>

If it's possible to nest in an infinite amount of combinations, then _it'll be impossible to accurately curate values that satisfy mixed influence_. In other words, while we can have some degree of certainty that a nested mode structure such as `light` → `critical` finally shows text color as "red", we cannot be confident that it will be red when a new expression is injected such as `light` → `cobranding` → `critical` because the cobranding's accent color may conflict with the given red and expects a different treatment. We lose even more confidence with the more modes included; causing more ripple effects to the final result.

## Values of influence

What this makes me believe is that in a mode-driven expressive system, we'll need a way to describe how a value should be influenced, as opposed to prescribing a specific value. Again, this is very much aligned in the way that a blend mode would work. When a mode is set, rules are applied to adjust the current values to make them more appropriate within the given mode. In a perfect world, they would not apply specific values but instead apply functions that transform the current existing value in a predetermined and expected manner.

And here's where we hit execution the wall. There is no _straightforward_ way to support this directly in CSS [^1] because it is effectively expecting to do the following:

```css
/* This is invalid CSS */
[data-mode="critical"] {
    --text-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--text-color) 80%, red);
}
```

What this pseudo-CSS attempts is to receive the current `--text-color` and modify it slightly by adding red for later use within its current "critical" scope and further downstream scopes. **You cannot reassign a CSS custom property using the current value of that property.** I also know attempting to determine the appropriate algorithms to accurately describe an expression would be very challenging; and frustrating to designers looking to have fine-tuned control over the final value for known mode nesting combinations.

Let me be clear, I cannot even begin to understand what an influence on a value might look like to satisfy this method.

All is not lost! If it is possible to predetermine what the expected nesting structure is, then we can know the series of possible nesting behaviors upfront and curate values accordingly; avoiding difficult computations.

## Nesting behavior

The question we want to ask to make things simpler is: **is there a regular pattern to nesting these mode placements?** I _think_ there could be. Certainly, I can envision the common case where the user preference informs the page-level mode (eg., light or dark), while lower modes describe scoped expressive areas. The brand in this mode influences the curation decisions occurring for the tokens. In other words, while I am in the process of choosing values for `light`, I am also thinking within the context of what it might mean for this particular brand (eg., McDonald's) to be portrayed as in a light mode.

This means that the file naming convention should suggest what brand was considered when curating the values. Eg., `mcd-light.json`. This is so if cobranding does occur, that the difference in curation is apparent (eg., `dunkin-light.json`).

Now, here comes the complexity. The concept of `light` — already influenced by brand — will _also influence_ the concept of `critical`. There will be a way of presenting a critical message for McDonald's when the user is in light mode and a different presentation when in dark mode for the same brand. This would mean that the files we would be managing would be more like `mcd-light-default` and `mcd-light-critical`, among others.

Importantly, these examples are only targeting color. It is very possible to have modes that affect other facets of the experience like density. I assume that color is _probably_ the only one of these which can compound across modes in the way described above; as `light` influences `critical`. Further compounding could also occur; when additional expressions are added in-between (see [How deep is your mode](#how-deep-is-your-mode) earlier in this post), where a promotional newsletter signup within a branded `light` preferred experience is meant to display an error. In this way, you might result in a file as `mcd-light-promo-critical.json` to express this very specific mode. So, with this in mind, perhaps a standard construction of a mode file could be:

```yaml
[brand]-[device]-[purpose]-[system].json
```

Note that there are variations of this meant for different nesting configurations.

```yaml
[brand]-[device].json # mcd-light.json
[brand]-[device]-[system].json # mcd-light-critical.json
[brand]-[device]-[purpose].json # mcd-light-promo.json
[brand]-[device]-[purpose]-[system].json # mcd-light-promo-critical.json
```

<Aside>
    It might be important to maintain the full syntax using placeholders so `system` and `purpose` don't have conflicts.

    ```yaml
    mcd-light-_-_.json
    mcd-light-_-critical.json
    mcd-light-promo-_.json
    mcd-light-promo-critical.json
    ```
</Aside>

The structure attempts to guide the curation process, indicating that deciding what color text should be depends on the _factors_ in this structure. Each part has some influence on the final value for each token.

So for a dark footer, you could either assign the values from `mcd-light-inverted.json` or assign `mcd-dark.json`. I imagine both of these would have the same values. But having both also allows for the possibility of them _not_ having the same values. This allows for `mcd-light-inverted.json` to not entirely match `mcd-dark.json` because it is deemed inappropriate for what we want to convey as "inverted". [The naming of modes is another separate exercise of defining purpose.](/posts/ondark-virus) However, you could also have some mechanism of aliasing such that a request for `mcd-light-inverted.json` simply returns `mcd-dark.json` until it is inappropriate to do so.

Overall, what this explains is that in this method of scalable interface design, we must know the possible nested mode structures to curate values appropriately. Declaring the factors through the file name and later the scoped data attribute selector should suffice as a clear indication of the intent behind this curated set. In fact, the data attribute value would inform the expectation of nesting for an interface.

```html
<body data-mode="mcd-light">
    <section data-mode="mcd-light-promo">
        <form data-mode="mcd-light-promo-critical"></form>
    </section>
</body>
```

<Aside>

In the self-referential ["influence values"](#values-of-influence) world, these parts are clearer because the compound nature of factors would only exist as decided in the interface and wouldn't need to be predefined upfront. Instructions on how to influence the base value would be encoded at each mode.


```html
<body data-mode="mcd light">
    <section data-mode="promo">
        <form data-mode="critical"></form>
    </section>
</body>
```
This has the added benefit of not needing to know how deep we are in the possible nesting. But at the moment, we don't have nice things.

</Aside>

## Outside of color

While color is possibly the most apparent change to control through a theming system, other changes are possible; maybe even less complex. For example, looking at the construction of mode files from before, I don't believe many of these attributes would influence typography. As a thought experiment, let's say we have a multibrand platform and we need to curate possible modes for different expressions. How might the typography change within the experience given all the factors we've defined above?

- Brand selects a typeface and other font metrics for that family.
- [The user preference for font size influences the final result by way of `(r)em` units](/posts/62-5) without the need to have a new mode file defined.
- A new purpose _could_ introduce a new typeface, perhaps something fancier with associated metrics.
- System scope should inherit all earlier typography values with no further changes.

This means that we could have a final file set for typography as the following:

```yaml
    mcd-_-_-_.typography.json
    mcd-_-promo-_.typography.json
```

And yes, this suggests our earlier files would strictly manipulate color (ie., `mcd-light-promo-critical.color.json`) so that these collections could be mixed and matched as appropriate. You can include some fallback logic that determines if a particular request for a specific collection isn't found to fallback to a more generic one.
