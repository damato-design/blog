There are [79 examples for the card component](https://component.gallery/components/card/) found at [The Component Gallery](https://component.gallery/components/); easily in the top 10 most found across the showcased design systems. It seems obvious that the card is something that becomes one of the resources found in most libraries.

## OUTLINE

    - Including my own ./against-atomic-design
  - A reusable packaged resource with a unique generic purpose and consistent layout composition.
    - Reusable packaged resource means it comes as one asset.
    - Unique generic purpose means that the resource has one reason to exist in relation to other components.
    - Consistent layout composition means that its construction does not vary given the same content.
- What is a card?
  - A card is a composition representing an entity. It comes with much of the same elements as a simple web page.
  - Often the card could be a text/image link or a bulletpoint instead.
  - Most entities have a stakeholder.
  - Several variations of Compass listing card, owned by the listing team.
  - The way a recipe is meant to be portrayed is likely different from a movie you can watch now.
