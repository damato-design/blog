In the book "[Syntactic Structures](https://books.google.com/books/about/Syntactic_Structures.html?id=a6a_b-CXYAkC)", linguist [Noam Chomsky](https://chomsky.info/) composes the following sentence:

{% quote "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously" "Noam Chomsky" %}
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
{% endquote %}

The example demonstrates a sentence that is grammatically correct but possess no meaning. You might imagine someone who has a dictionary without definitions and creates sentences just by following the rules of grammar. This analogy can translate into design; a person could have a naive understanding of tools and put things together based on guidelines to make an engaging experience but ultimately miss the purpose.

## The medium is the message

A great painter doesn't only possess the creativity to make a beautiful scene, they also know their medium. They know how the paints work together, and how they adhere to the canvas. They can make decisions on what kinds of paints to use against a certain canvas. They will have an in-depth knowledge of these factors to achieve satisfying results. They also know the limitations of the medium; they should not create a sculpture with the paint. It doesn't mean that they cannot continuously layer paint onto the canvas to produce a sculpture. It means that approach is unexpected to the medium.

When designing products for a population, the best approach is to design as expected. Create experiences people are familiar with well-established patterns. It doesn't mean you can't experiement in limited capacities, but it does mean that you might not receive the same engagement that an expected interaction would have.

The point is that as a designer working in a medium (ie., the web), you should know how that medium works. What is expected and what the pitfalls are. While you could learn these things through conversations and media; I feel the best way is to actually code.

## How to not become an engineer

The most important step is to find a problem to solve, specifically something that strikes you personally. As a designer this should be easy compared to others who are looking to start coding. This is important because the problem you solve will be _your_ problem. Something you're passionate about. It might even be a portfolio project that you designed.

Now that you've decided what the problem is, design it (if you haven't already). Go through the normal process of user experience to create the best solution for your problem.

It is at this point you will need to go into uncharted territory. What will be helpful is remembering that this is _your_ problem, no one elses. It is totally up to you if you want to actually make this solution real. It is that idea that presents the motivation to reach a working solution. Break down the problem into smaller chunks. Maybe try working on the layout first. How do I change the background color? How do I make a link? Maybe you're most interested in rendering data to the page. How do I request data and where would I even get it from?

Here's where you use all your search engine skills to find your answers. Look at what others have done, steal code and make it your own, ask engineers in your circle about things.

It's very likely you might try to bite off more than you can chew. That's ok, because this isn't for the purpose of landing your first engineering role. This is to get a better understanding about the medium where you are responsible design. Any knowledge gained in this exercise is a benefit. Engineers started coding at some point, knowing just as much as you do now.

## Let me be clear

- Designers _shouldn't_ be expected to code as a part of their role.
- Designers _shouldn't_ be responsible for the final execution of a experience in terms of engineering.
- Designers _should_ be knowledgable about the medium they are designing for; it's features and constraints.
- Designers _should_ reconsider novel design approaches in favor of user and medium expectations.
