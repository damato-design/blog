In the book "[Syntactic Structures](https://books.google.com/books/about/Syntactic_Structures.html?id=a6a_b-CXYAkC)", linguist [Noam Chomsky](https://chomsky.info/) composes the following sentence:

{% quote "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously" "Noam Chomsky" %}
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
{% endquote %}

The example demonstrates a sentence that is grammatically correct but possess no meaning. You might imagine someone who has a dictionary without definitions and creates sentences just by following the rules of grammar. This analogy can translate into design; a person could have a naive understanding of colors that go well together but ultimately miss the purpose; to provide a usable experience.

## The medium is the message

A great painter doesn't only possess the creativity to make a beautiful scene, they also know their medium. They know how the paints work together, and how they adhere to the canvas. They can make decisions on what kinds of paints to use against a certain canvas. They will have an in-depth knowledge of these factors to achieve satisfying results. They also know the limitations of the medium; they should not create a sculpture with the paint. It doesn't mean that they cannot continuously layer paint onto the canvas to produce a sculpture. It means that approach is unexpected to the medium.

When designing products for a population, the best approach is to design as expected. Create experiences people are familiar with well-established patterns. It doesn't mean you can't experiement in limited capacities, but it does mean that you might not receive the same engagement that an expected interaction would have. There is friction for users that come across new patterns. When you [reduce this friction](LAWS OF UX) and present experiences that users are commonly familiar with, your experience is percieved as faster, more efficient, and beneficial.

In order to understand expectations as a designer working in a medium (ie., the web), you should have a general understanding of how that medium works. What is expected and what the pitfalls are. While you could learn these things through conversations and media; I feel the best way is to actually code. [DO IT MEME]

**Let me be clear**

- Designers _shouldn't_ be expected to code as a part of their role.
- Designers _shouldn't_ be responsible for the final execution of a experience in terms of engineering.
- Designers _should_ be knowledgable about the medium they are designing for; it's features and constraints.
- Designers _should_ reconsider novel design approaches in favor of user and medium expectations.

## How to not become an engineer

The goal is not to create a new kind of canvas; the goal is to learn about the difference canvases by experiementing. As a designer, you might have some explorations you've done in a design tool. Think about what it might take to create one of them. Think about how you learned your design tool and use the same strategies to learn how to make a web page. Try not to get caught up in framework debates or special tools because that can become overwhelming. I'd recommend using a tool like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), which removes a lot of fluff and most importantly gives you immediate feedback to your changes. No switching between a browser and code editor, no running terminal commands. Just type "Hello world" in the HTML panel and see the result in the page. Congratulations, you've wrote some code!

Next, try to make a wireframe of one of your explorations. The web is just boxes so figure out how to make a box and how to position it in the right spot. See what it takes and what happens when you change the size of the window for different devices. Learn a little bit about that flexbox and CSS grid everyone keeps talking about. Does that help you place the boxes better? Probably. Can you conjure your own CSS incantations to put boxes wherever you want? Maybe not but that's ok! That's an engineer's job. You're just learning more about how the web works.

Now take it further. Add some text and change the size. How would a user type into a form? What happens when you change the zoom of the page? What about when you hit the tab key, can you see what control you'll be affecting next? Really think about _all_ users here; who you might not have considered and how could it affect what you've made. Is there anything that can be done to make the result more inclusive? It's insights like this which will close the communication gap between you and your engineers.

Now you're ready to have a new canvas made to your specifications for a perfect masterpiece made for everyone.
