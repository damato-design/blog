- Designers shouldn't be expected to code as a part of their role.
- Designers shouldn't be responsible for the final execution of a experience in terms of engineering.

So why should they code?

## The medium is the message

A great painter doesn't only know how to create a beautiful scene, they also know their medium. They know how the paints work together, and how they adhere to the canvas. They can make decisions on what kinds of paints to use against a certain canvas. They will have an in-depth knowledge of these factors to achieve satisfying results. They also know the limitations of the medium; they should not create a sculpture with the paint. It doesn't mean that they cannot continuously layer paint onto the canvas to produce a sculpture. It means that approach is unexpected to the medium.

When designing products for a population, the best approach is to design as expected. Create experiences people are familiar with are well-established. It doesn't mean you can't experiement in limited capacities, but it does mean that you might not receive the same engagement that a well-established interaction would have.

The point is that as a designer working in a medium (ie., the web), you should know how that medium works. What is expected and what the constraints are. While you could learn these things through conversations with engineers; I feel the best way is to actually code.

## How to not become an engineer

The most important step is to find a problem to solve, specifically something that strikes you personally. As a designer this should be easy compared to others who are looking to start coding. This is important because the problem you solve will be _your_ problem. Something you're passionate about. It might even be a portfolio project that you designed.

Now that you've decided what the problem is, design it (if you haven't already). Go through the normal process of user experience to create the best solution for your problem.

It is at this point you will need to go into uncharted territory. What will be helpful is remembering that this is _your_ problem, no one elses. It is totally up to you if you want to actually make this solution real. It is that idea that gives the motivation to reach a working solution. Break down the problem into smaller chunks. Maybe try working on the layout first. How do I change the background color? How do I make a link? Maybe you're most interested in rendering data to the page. How do I request data?

Here's where you use all your search engine skills to find your answers. Look at what others have done, steal code and make it your own, ask your fellow engineers about things.
