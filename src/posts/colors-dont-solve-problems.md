title: Colors don't solve problems
desc: I argue that we spend too much time curating color in design systems and as a result we lose focus against much more important priorities.

First and foremost, I'm color deficient. You might have heard of this as color-blindness however, I am not blind to color. I do not see the world in only black-and-white. I can see colors, just not as well compared to most people. I can appreciate a good synthwave hot pink most of the time. In college, I told one of my art professors that I was color deficient and I'll never forget what he said:

Maybe you should consider a different major.

Luckily, I didn't wind up working in art. I work in design.

## Art is not design

Art is a freedom of an artist's expression; an attempt to convey a feeling through their medium. It is commonly an egocentric activity to achieve a desired appearance. This is in contrast to design, specifically product design, which is striving for altruism and inclusivity. This is supported through pattern recognition and reusing familiar experiences to achieve a goal. Design systems are the ultimate solution for achieving this cohesive experience; establishing trust between the user and the product. One deviation from past experience could be enough for the user to hesitate on the next step or stop the progress indefinitely.

In design, form follows function. It means that something should be usable before it is beautiful. In order to do this, we must identify the problem we need to solve. In a qualified user experience practice, this will not begin with designing an interface but with research. Interviews, competitive analysis, user personas, and all the truth finding techniques to paint the best picture of the problem so that you can begin to hypothesize a solution.

## Wirecutting

After completing a phase of user research, the next task is not jumping into high-fidelity, pixel-perfect mockups. I'll coin the term "wirecutting" for when a designer cuts out this wireframing step. Wireframing helps visualize the flow and features expected to support the user's goals. In this process, it is easy to see when cluttered interfaces appear and the priority of elements reevalutated. These are commonly without color and for good reason. Color is a distracting exercise here past notation to provide more clarity. Though it could be argued that an elegant experience would not need further explanation than the given wireframes and avoid color even for this exercise. Striving for simpilicity will result in a future of thankful users starting at the wireframe stage.

I believe in a world where wireframes are piped into a tool which creates high-fidelity mockups using the rules and guidance of a design system. Amazingly, this world is here in the form of [Uizard](https://uizard.io/). Using this tool, designers can avoid the nuiances of following the system guidelines and focus on the experience by wireframing.

Of course this assumes a design system is in place. So let's now focus specifically in this area.
