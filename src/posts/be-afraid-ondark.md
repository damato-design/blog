The "ondark" virus is infecting token names in the design systems community everywhere. I've tried providing recommendations in token related posts and replies before. However, it seems this approach is becoming more wide-spread so I want to give it one final try to describe the problem with this naming scheme and provide a remedy.

## The problem

Imagine you have a UI which is primarily light colored. Perhaps a white background with nearly black text. There's a section in this UI that you want to have a stark contrast with the rest of the page. In this section, you have some text lockup and a call-to-action button. The button has all the same properties that other buttons in the system have, except it's located on this dark background.

Most folks might have a button prepared specifically for this scenario. We might even provide a configuration for when this happens in code. Under the hood, that might reference different tokens which point to specific `ondark` values sent to the page.

This works fine for this section which covers just the background, text, and button.

Soon after, a request comes in to show a comparison table in this area; showcasing the benefits of the product of feature. In the current system, you'd need tokens to describe all of the borders of the table. Maybe you have something generic that targets borders in this area. But unfortunately you might see a problem begin to appear.

The problem is that for every UI element that _might_ appear in this section in the future, you'd need to define an entire new set of tokens to describe the color for that UI. This is especially exhausting since you've already defined tokens semanitcally for all of these things in the "default" environment. To fully cover the dark area, you'd need to **double the amount of token names** to include the additional "ondark" (or "inverse", "reverse", "contrast") infix.

No bueno.

## Semantic tokens or bust

The first step is fully investing in semantic tokens. [I've called them "intents"](./tokens-as-intents) in the past to further enforce the expectation that the name describes purpose over value. We're talking about token names like `--button-background` or `--input-focused-critical-border-color` which give information about the component or pattern and the property being influenced. In no way does it give any information about what the value of this color is. The more you avoid encoding the value in the name, the more flexible your system will be with the opportunity for that color to change in the future.

This extends to any token; describe the purpose and avoid the value when naming.

## Scoped themes

A theme is the collection of values assigned to semantic tokens. The semantic tokens are a contract that should have permanence and meet expectations of folks building UI over time. These are the tokens that appear on the _left-side_ of a theme. The values that would appear on the _right-side_ can and should have a separate stakeholder, most likely one that represents a brand. I recommend avoiding managing both sides if possible to not introduce subjective bias or confusion in token naming.

![Be responsible for the left side theme assignment, avoid the right side](../images/token-responsibility.png)

I cannot stress enough, **how values are assigned on the right-side does not matter**. Values can be referenced, hard-coded, computed, or otherwise. A color palette is influenced by the brand and determines what `--brand-blue-500` means along with what parts of the UI should use that color. Here, the brand is responsible for curating the right-side values and how they are assigned to the left-side.

The design system team is responsible for maintaining consistency on the left-side; that's it. They should only focus on the semantic token names for those values to be assigned and how they might support describing the experience at scale.

{% aside "warning" %}
While I advocate for design systems folks to be hands-off for the right-side of the theme, it is not possible to be completely ignorant of what happens there. We should be providing guidance on best practices when curating the other side, especially in terms of accessibility. We should provide feedback when people attempt to choose color combinations that have low contrast or font-sizes that are illegible.

And certainly when posed with limited resources, it's entirely possible for the design system team to manage both sides.
{% endaside %}

{% aside %}
Note that the idea of "dark-mode" is also well represented by providing a dark theme. A user preference for "high-contrast mode" is asking for a high-contrast theme. The mode is the user preference. The theme is a collection of assignments that aim to satisfy the mode.
{% endaside %}

Now for the key insight. Instead of the dark area and the light colored page needing to be informed by a single theme, **think of the dark area as an entirely separate theme**. In this way, the values that represent `--button-background` can change depending on scope.

- **No additional configuration at the component level.** You don't need to remember or even know that this button is on a "dark" surface.
- **No additional token names.** Self explanatory, naming is hard and scaling those names is even harder.

Now the only name you need is the one describing the theme; "dark".

## Moving forward

This still requires the design token values to be curated to account for a dark UI. If you worried about defining an entire new theme worth of tokens, start small. Only define the ones you need at first; maybe background, text and button. At some point you might have the resources to define it all and then you'll have an entire new theme to try.

I've considered going farther in this, specifically with surfaces that expect to demonstrate feedback (eg., warning banner). You might imagine this banner similar to the dark section above with a text lockup and action to take. I say if you have the resources to prepare this as a theme, go for it! You'll be better prepared for when code samples might appear within the notification. Otherwise, you'll need to be highly restrictive to the kinds of content that appear within various colored surfaces. And we all know how much designers love restrictions. ðŸ˜‰

This new recommendation also requires that the system delivering themes be flexible enough to request more than one. I think there's an opportunity for some optimization here as well; where we statically analyze the page for tokens used within scopes and only serve what's needed. However, to start you could just import the theme when a scope is added. The benefit of this is if the scoped theme hasn't been included or the scope hasn't been applied, it'll fallback to the base theme values instead.

```html
<body>
    <button>This button has a black background</button>
    <section data-theme="dark">
        <!-- Missing definition for the dark theme, 
        everything here inherits from the light theme -->
        <button>This button has a black background</button>
    </section>
</body>
```

This is in contrast to [what I've recommended before](./tokens-as-intents) and I've learned from that mistake. The possibility of multiple types of buttons to appear on an colored background requires something better. With this experience, I have confidence that it is.
