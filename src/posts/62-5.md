WHY USE REM?

Today, `rem` units are very common on the web and often used to describe space.

There was [a trick by Richrd Rutter](https://clagnut.com/blog/348/) discovered many years ago which was meant to help folks better understand relative font-size units. The trick is to set the `font-size` of the document to `62.5%`.

```css
html {
    font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

The `62.5%` _looks like_ what we like to call a [magic number](https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/), it seems oddly specific. The number is the ratio 10:16 as a percent. The default `rem` is 16 pixels, so 1/16th of a `rem` equals one pixel. Multiplying by 10 helps keep the font size readable (`6.25%` is too small, `625%` too large). Then the final use of this declaration allows for the following:

```css
button {
    padding: .8rem 1.6rem; /* 8px 16px */
}
```

Here, it is possible to write `rem` in terms of pixels. This provides [the benefits of `rem`](https://uxdesign.cc/why-designers-should-move-from-px-to-rem-and-how-to-do-that-in-figma-c0ea23e07a15) while maintaining a pixel mental model. [This post by Aleksandr Hovhannisyan](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/62-5-percent-font-size-trick/) goes into the approach in more detail also mentioning accessibility considerations. Some design systems (eg., [Workbench by Gusto](https://workbench.gusto.com/getting-started/engineers/#css-resets)) use the approach to make it "easier" to work with `rem` units.

## What's so hard?

The fact is that the `rem` doesn't exist in design tools, so a translation from pixels to `rem` must occur to the web. Instead of manually trying to figure out what the final number should be based on a formula or repeating the formula every time we need to use `rem`, it is "easier" for the translation to occur globally.

## Absolutely arbitrary font-size

When you select a pixel font-size, what does it mean? What is the difference between Courier and Verdana at 16px? In practice it's meant to represent [the `em` square](https://typography.guru/term/em-square-r46). In the harsh reality, [it doesn't really mean anything](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/4035/what-does-the-size-of-the-font-translate-to-exactly). That means we could use 16 pigs, or 1 barn, maybe 8 sinks to talk about font-size. It actually doesn't matter as long as the visual result is expected.

So why do we need to use the pixel value so much? It's because that's what design tools have decided to use to define the font-size. If the design tool was to include the `rem`, we would have a 1:1 relationship between the design expectation and the engineering execution and no need to require this translation at all. You could speak in terms of `rem` right in the tool.

## Subverting expectations

When the `font-size` value is redefined at the `html` element, the representation of the `rem` is changed for the _entire document_. This means that third-party elements could look incorrect, expecting the `rem` not to be redefined and instead expect the browser `16px` default. This even includes usage of `rem` in the [Shadow DOM](https://blog.openreplay.com/shadow-dom--the-ultimate-guide/). Josh W. Comeau [calls this out in this post](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#the-sixtwofive-trick-13). He also mentions that adoption is difficult because it would need to be done all at once. This also means that deprecating the approach is also troublesome.
